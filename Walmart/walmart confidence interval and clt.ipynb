Walmart has more than 100 million customers worldwide\n\n### Business Problem\n\nThe Management team at Walmart Inc. wants to analyze the customer purchase behavior (specifically, purchase amount) against the customerâ€™s gender and the various other factors to help the business make better decisions. They want to understand if the spending habits differ between male and female customers: Do women spend more on Black Friday than men? (Assume 50 million customers are male and 50 million are female).\n\n\n### Dataset\n\nThe company collected the transactional data of customers who purchased products from the Walmart Stores during Black Friday.
